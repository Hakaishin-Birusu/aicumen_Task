Problem Statement :
Problem Statement: Design a contract which would allow below functions to be executed:
1)Allow ERC20 tokens, representing US Dollars (Token symbol as USD), as well as ERC20 tokens, representing Indian Rupees (Token symbol as INR) to be collected in the contract with a promise of getting in return the equivalent alternative currency after a certain period automatically (Might want to explore Oraclize?)
2)Maintain a ledger who sent which ERC20 token and how much amount in the contract for reconciliation later.
3)Emit out an event for every incoming and outgoing transaction.
4)Refrain user from withdrawing the tokens he deposited manually.
